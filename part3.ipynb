    "The reason for applying *'Oversampling'* will be explained in detail. When developing the predictive model, a model development with and without cross-validation will be compared to see the impact of cross-validation involvments in the predictive model development. Moreover, the right way of applying sampling techniques with cross-validation will also be discussed here. *'Random Oversampling'* is the sampling technique to be adopted to inflate the number of data points in the minority class of the dataset."
