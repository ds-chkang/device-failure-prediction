# Device Failure Predictive Model
The purpose of this project is to show the ways of improving a predictive model with an imbalanced dataset.

Part 1
- Model building without data preprocessing, feature engineering, and feature selection.

Part 2
- Model building with Feature Selection.

Part 3
- Model building with Outlier Removal and Feature Selection.

Part 4
- Model building with Outlier Removal, Standarization, and Feature Selection.
